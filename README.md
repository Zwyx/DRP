Dark Reader Plus â€” Dark mode for custom pages

This really simple Chrome extension will make the background of the create-react-app error handler dark. So it won't burn your eyes anymore if you use dark themes.

## Installation

- Open `chrome://extensions`
- Activate Developer mode
- Click Load unpacked and open the src folder of this repo.

You might want to adjust the content of `manifest.json` to target your development environment.
